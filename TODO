- Redesign configuration mechanism. Ideally for every month there shall be one command like: "\Jan{photo}{descru}{descen}..."
- Redesign GetMonth* functions. Ugly now. Connected with the task of redesigning configuration storage
- Make page size configurable without need to creae new template (shoudl be pretty easy)
- Replace all bitmap flags to the vector ones (tikz?)
- Redesign \smallmonths. It should take only 1 argument: month name. left and right months shoudl be calculated on the fly


Nice to do:
- Add mirror to the title in the first page.  Example from pgfmanual does not work in the context of this template. opacity is not respected at all.
