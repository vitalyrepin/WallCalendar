<p>The goal of this project is to establish a free repository of high-quality wall calendars templates for a variety of countries. Having this repository in place will allow to prepare high-quality calendars for everybody who is not an expert in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing">DTP</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="motivation-for-the-project" class="anchor" href="#motivation-for-the-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation for the project</h2>

<p>What are the major steps to produce a wall calendar?</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide on the paper size and number of pages</li>
<li>Prepare the Interior and Covers.</li>
<li>Publish it (using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand">POD</a> services</li>
</ol><p>Format of the Interior and Covers should meet publisher's requirements. It is time-consuming and boring task to prepare Interior and Covers which satisfy them for those who are not DTP experts.</p>

<p>That's the reason most of the people who want to create their own calendar (e.g., based on their photos) go to the photo publishing services which makes it easy to produce custom calendars. But the downside of this are very limited possibilities of customization. Usually you only can modify the photos and add your dates to the calendar grid.</p>

<p>That's why this project is started. The aim is to free you from the boring parts of the calendar preparation process by reusing collective knowledge (templates layouts re-usage but also getting all the holidays in place for the given year and specific country) and let you be focused on the creative tasks. But without limiting the creativity in the way photo services are doing!</p>

<a name="project-structure" class="anchor" href="#project-structure"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project structure</h2>

<p>This project contains set of resources and tools which make it extremely easy to prepare your own calendar which is ready for publishing.</p>

<h3>
<a name="templates" class="anchor" href="#templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Templates</h3>

<p>Wall calendar templates. Template is a set of TeX files and Makefile to build pdfs out of them.
It contains two customization files - <em>customization.tex</em> and <em>custom.mk</em>.</p>

<p>These files shall be changed by the user of template in order to produce calendar.
They contain names of the images, celebrations, holidays and other parameters of the template.</p>

<p>The fact that template is a set of TeX file makes it easy to make your own template based on existing one.
You don't need to make the template from scratch - you can re-use existing template and modify it to suit your needs!</p>

<h3>
<a name="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>This directory contains the free (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/">CC BY SA</a>) graphical resources which could be used by ANY calendar template. In particular, it contains the
vector flags which could be used by a calendar template in order to mark certain days with a special icon.</p>

<h3>
<a name="management-script" class="anchor" href="#management-script"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Management script</h3>

<p>Script <em>CalManage.pl</em> is located in the root directory of the project.  It simplifies the template/calendar management process.
It allows to create a project directory for  new calendar based on specific template, list existing templates and calendars.</p>

<h3>
<a name="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h3>

<p>An example of  the calendar created with the help of this project is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/vitaly-repin/calendar-2014-the-four-seasons/paperback/product-21271953.html">"The Four Seasons 2014" calendar, published at lulu.com</a>.</p>
